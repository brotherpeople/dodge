# Unity 2D Bullet Hell Game Project

## Overview
A simple 2D bullet hell game developed in Unity where players must survive against an increasing number of projectiles. The game features dynamic difficulty scaling, with the number of bullets gradually increasing over time to create an increasingly challenging experience.

## Core Mechanics
Players control a character within a confined space while dodging bullets that spawn from all four directions. The game maintains a constant number of active bullets and increases this number every 5 seconds, making survival progressively more challenging. The game tracks and displays both play time and current bullet count, ending when the player collides with any bullet.

## Technical Stack
- Developed using Unity 2022.3.38f1
- Programmed in C#

## Game Controls
- Press SPACE to start the game
